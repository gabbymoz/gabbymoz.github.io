                <h4 >Work Experience and Projects</h4>
                <p>I was given the opportunity to work in the role of a professional services engineer in Ocuco for the duration of my internship. The name Ocuco is short for ocular and company mixed together. It is an Irish owned company with many international offices such as USA, Canada and all over Europe. This company supports an optical software which was created as a clinical recording system, making it easier for the ophthalmic industries to carry on their eye care work and processes online rather than using paper and doing their eye care practices reporting individually. In 1997 ocucos practice management system started to cover optical enterprise stores, managing to create thousands of new international clients with the installation of Ocucos software called ‘Acuitas’. Since then, today over 8,000 client sites across 77 countries are using Ocucos products and services. 

                    Ocucos management structure of the company starts off with the head office in the company who obtain the roles of CEO, CTO and CFO’s. From this it follows down to our management directors who are in charge of handing out tasks and making sure the companies managers are keeping up to task with their allocated teams. In my case, mine is in the ‘Support Team’. The other teams in the company would be IT, Development, Operations, QA, Sales and Marketing and Finance.
                    
                    The role of the Support team is to manage related software issues reported by our customers by phone and email and to manage these issues and bug reportings through JIRA. Other roles would include working with our clients database administrator, updating and making changes to the customers database only when needed. Teamviewer is highly used throughout the company to access remotely to our customers servers and client machines when investigating issues to report and fix them remotely as many of our customers are based all around the world with no way to physically be able to investigate the issues when entering their stores which was what was done before covid.
                    
                  
                </p>
                <h4>Projects</h4>
                <p>Description:		The application is known as Car Reviews which was developed in a group project. It is a multi-subscriber web application about cars where multiple users can subscribe and receive messages from the application. 
                  Users can also send their own messages to the application where it is then stored into the database and uploaded onto the front end of the application. Features include a front end interactable website and a secure remote 
                  communication based on the MQTT mosquitto system, updating, testing and modifications to the website.</p>
          
                <p> Challenges faced:
                  Connecting the MQTT mosquitto system with the database software and website HTML
                  Storing the messages from the database onto the website HTML where it can be viewed by users
                  Sending the correct and suitable messages that were sent by users and categorizing them into their specific fields
                  Designing the website layout to make it as suitable for users as possible</p>
                  
                <p> Technologies & Tools Used:
                  Javascript, CSS, HTML, MQTT Mosquitto, Linux bash scripting, Azuredevops, Selenium, GitHub, Firebase, Python
